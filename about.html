                Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English), 
                or Xs and Os (Canadian or Irish English) is a paper-and-pencil game for two 
                players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. 
                The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, 
                or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming 
                best play from both players.
